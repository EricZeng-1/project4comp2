    The thing that went best in my essay was the introduction and the conclusions. One of the more challenging aspects of the paper was the discussion because I basically rambled on for over 1000 words. I learned that the best way to keep children away from delinquent behaviors is to make sure they have a nurturing and supportive environment. The thing that I learned about secondary research methods is that novels contain the most information, and it is generally more accurate than other websites. The question I have is, is it okay if I put citations in the discussion part is that only supposed to be commentary?

My audience was my roommate. I talked to him this morning because after I woke up I stayed on my bed and complained about how I was super tired and did not want to get out of bed. There was no constraint, I just told him how I did not want to get out of bed, but also how I needed to go to class.

To be so honest, I never really enjoyed language arts, I always sucked at it. My writing skills were average, I did not like to read much, and I just overall did not have the thought process to be good at writing. However, for some reason, I really enjoyed ENC 2135. I mean sure it had its downs, but it definitely had its ups. I do not think I have ever enjoyed and learned so much in an english class before. Throughout highschool, I touched on Rhetorical appeals and genres for a bit, but I never clearly understood what it was. In ENC2135; however, we went into depth about these two core elements. I learned about how to use different genres to convey the same information, but to different audiences. I learned many new rheotrics that helped me compose projects 1, 2, and 3. 
<br>
     <br>
Genre is a type of art that conveys a certain message to its audience, I also further expanded my knowledge on the rhetorical appeals, Ethos, Pathos, and Logos, in order to persuade the audience. After spending a good chunk of class time going over the different genres and Rhetorical strategies, we were able to put them into writing for our projects. We were given a lot of freedom to write about what we enjoyed writing about, as long as it was related to our subject. Being able to write about things I enjoyed really helped me grind these papers out. One of my favorite parts of this class was when I got to construct 3 different genres, this really put my brain and creativity to work. 
    <br>

My subject, the effects of bad parenting on a child's behavior, really piqued my interest because I wanted to know the impacts of Bad Parenting. While researching for these projects, I was able to really understand the uses of rhetorical strategies. I can use certain diction and pathos in order to appeal to older or younger audiences, and that I can use ethos in order to reinforce my arguments. I learned how to make specific artifacts that are different genres in order to appeal to different audiences. I wrote a letter to appeal to the Florida Department of Children and Families, while making a bright brochure to appeal to younger audiences. 
     <br>
<br>
Something I wish I honestly did different in class was pay more attention to the different uses of rheotrical strategies and genres, I know that it was a big part of the class, but I feel like I could have learned way more about rhetorical strategies and genres had I really tried. I know the basics and how to identify different genres and strategies. Also something I could have worked more on was the project 2 draft, I feel that what I did for the draft was honestly lacking, and it made it harder for me to actually compare and contrast them after I wrote them. If I had started with comparing and contrasting and not writing about both of them separately I could have made my project 2 much better than it was.
